                    <p>
                        I'm Chinese, from Chengdu in the People's Republic. I married Jon Valentine&#129333;&#128112; in 1997 in Helsinki&#128146;. I was in Finland doing a Master's degree&#127891; (in Finnish!!!), when I met Jon. He's English. He said Valentine is a Scottish-Jewish name, but he's from Yorkshire. He talks &#128162;rubbish&#128162;... :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am full-time LINGsCARS business owner and I specialise in supplying new UK Contract Hire, (and sometimes PCP, Lease cars and Lease Hire) &#128663;cars and &#128656;vans. LINGsCARS consumes my life to make it a very successful business&#128175;. In 2008, I moved over £35,000,000 of brand new cars!

                        Yes, my family is mostly in China. My mum and dad &#128107; still live in Chengdu, Sichuan, and I go back&#9992; at least once every year. China is coming on, you know! Although the political situation is rotten&#129344;, it's stable and my family have a good life&#127774;. My mum's a famous dentist (over 70&#128117; but still working!), and my dad used to work for the government in the Environmental Service, but he's retired now&#129491;.

                        My sister Shan&#128590; works for the Sichuan Poverty Relief Office&#128224;, but in the Cultural Revolution, she used to be a red guard!&#128681; I'm too young to have been involved in all that rubbish. China's quite polluted, and not as green as the UK... plus there are so many people everywhere there. Life is more pleasant&#128157; here...and I've been naturalised now. I guess that makes me Chinglish. I am a successful immigrant at least! I did it legally, and I have succeeded. That puts a smile on my face&#9996;&#128513;.

                        My husband set up Caledonia Contracts&#128221;, then established Arena Contracts in London before he went to work for himself. He was very successful&#128175;, so I learnt the business and took over the reins. I must say I'm better at it than him!&#128527; The key&#128273; to this business is efficiency. This means that I give a very good personal service, I have very few overheads to add to the cost of the cars, plus I have a fully computerised system&#128187; that I built myself, that I am developing all the time. Computers and databases are my hobby&#129505;. I live on the internet. I consider myself to be the equivalent of Ryanair, in the Contract Hire business. In January 2006, FLEET NEWS, the car fleet operator's trade newspaper said; "(Ling is...) contract hire's Ryanair".

                    <p>
                        LINGsCARS.com gives better service than larger, posher businesses, but I have lower overheads&#128184;, offer cheaper prices&#128181; and do more business&#128176;; and the end result is that people can rent exactly the same cars for less. I spend a lot of my time finding the best deals&#127881; in the UK, then cutting out most of the larger companies' costs so that my cars are the UK's cheapest, and my service is simply the best&#128077;.

                        I have over 1000 customer letters published. In 2008, customer Alan Johnston wrote: "The most efficient business I have ever dealt with. Everything done so professionally. Kept totally informed step by step. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending LINGsCARS to anyone."

                        Yes. I have plenty of room for expansion. My plan is to double business every year. I am certainly not fully utilised with the level of business I am doing at the moment (between 150 and 250 cars per month). I have moved into a new LINGsCARS World Headquarters building that I have bought, not rented. My investments in the business go into efficiency savings and promotion, instead of dozens of staff. I have a small key team of fantastic people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many larger companies do what I do, but with many more staff shuffling paper backwards and forwards. I strive to do everything right first time, too. That's my trick to running this business at a good profit whilst undercutting everyone else. It's so simple, but it seems many people want to build organisations of dozens of people instead of doing the job themselves. If the right person comes along, then I would consider taking them on... but my small team achieves more than many larger organisations!

                        Oh, I use many large motor supply companies, and I make them compete for my business. You see, they know that they get pre-screened, computer generated information that enables them to do their jobs so quickly and easily that they seem willing to pass more of their savings on to me. It's amazing that many companies in this business still work with illegible, handwritten, incomplete and incorrect information on paper forms and they pass this amongst themselves until they have generated no end of problems. My system is as perfect and as simple as I can make it, and I seem to reap the rewards. My customers get the savings I make passed on to them. I often make my money out of bulk business bonuses that mean that I don't need to make 1p on the cost price of a car. So simple, but so hard for other firms, it seems. Am I giving away my secrets? I'd better stop...

                        I grew up in China, did my middle school (school is SUCH hard work in China, often working until midnight) ...and managed (very difficult, my mum pulled strings) to go to uni in Jinan (Guanzhou) and did Applied Chemistry at BSc level. I was punished in uni because I wouldn't do the morning PE regime. Then I went to Finland because it offered free MSc courses.

                    <p>
                        I arrived in Finland alone with very basic English and stood crying when I arrived at Helsinki airport in January 1997, but survived. I studied wood chemistry (in Finnish!) but flunked it - what a surprise! After marrying Jon and battling with the UK Home Office to come to the UK, I did my Master's in Environmental Quality in the UK at Bournemouth. It was hard, as my English wasn't brilliant at that time.

                    <p>
                        I learned a lot about data and information processing and efficient use of tools, and I use these skills in LINGsCARS.com, if that doesn't sound too ridiculous. It's quite true.

                        Oh, well, this is a bit of a story, but briefly... I like to publish everything I do on the internet. After getting massive publicity for my Nuclear Missile Truck, the BBC contacted me for Dragons' Den.

                    <p>
                        I really enjoyed doing the show and turned down their offers of investment (mainly because the % investment they wanted was so high), but also because I am not desperate for cash. Following Dragons' Den, I appeared on lots of other TV and radio, and now run successful TV advert campaigns.

                    <p>
                        I have also been one of the subjects of a BBC book, and have loads of other invitations for press and publicity opportunities. I make loads of small, fun films... you can see them on this site and on YouTube, and I am often invited to write editorial for things like business directories and blogs. I guess people like a different take on things.

                        Yes, I think so. I've never met another. Do I get a medal? I'll keep the red flag flying in the motor trade. At least people remember me because of it, but actually I'm quite proud to be Chinese, if not proud of the Chinese government.

                        I tasted tear gas in 1989, although in Chengdu not Beijing. There was much more happening than the Tianamen stuff. One day things will get better, it's actually much better now but still frustratingly "controlled" (anyone been to China will know what I mean), and I hope I'm doing my bit for Anglo-Sino relations. A shame there are no Chinese vehicles to sell in the UK (yet! The joke MG factory Nanjing Automotive has bought will never get its act together, though), but then everyone would moan about having to pedal them along, hahaha.

                        Oh, I'm hotheaded. I get angry&#128545; easily and then I shout&#129324;. You don't want to make me mad&#128293;. Sometimes I have to really hold myself back if someone is rude or loud on the phone&#128222;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Occasionally a customer can be really offensive&#128533;, you know how things happen sometimes - maybe they are having a bad day and then I spring some bad news on them like a delay in car build time at the factory or something. I have been known to tell someone never to darken my website again&#128683;, but that's very, very rare. Usually I end up great friends with customers!&#129309;

                        Racism never bothers me&#128581;, and it's very rare, or maybe I never notice it. I really can't understand people that are so politically correct that they think you don't have a racial identity. I'm quite proud my skin is yellow&#128519; and my eyes aren't round&#128064;. Over one billion of us can't be wrong, eh? You should hear how in China we describe English noses&#128067;, and anyway all the British look the same to me - that is a Chinese joke by the way.

                        I only ever swear in English, not in Chinese. My mum's doing; polite Chinese girls don't swear, you see.&#128522;

            Car and Vehicle leasing is the leasing of the use of a car for a fixed period 
            of time. It is a cost-effective alternative to car or vehicle purchase. It can 
            be known as PCP or contract hire. The key difference in a car lease is that 
            after the lease expires, the customer can return the car or vehicle to the dealer 
            for no cost, or can often buy it at an agreed price. Ling owns the UK’s favourite 
            car leasing company.<br><br>
            Rationale:<br>
            Car Leasing offers big advantages to customers. For the lease buyer, lease payments 
            will usually be lower than payments on a car loan would be and qualification is usually 
            easier. Some very cheap car leasing deals are available, but these change all the time. 
            Some consumers may prefer leasing as it allows them to simply return a car and select a 
            new model when the lease expires, allowing a consumer to drive a new vehicle every few 
            years without the responsibility of selling the old car. It’s a very simple car owning 
            solution. A car leasing customer does not have to worry about the future value of the 
            car or vehicle, while a vehicle owner does have this nagging doubt.<br><br>
            For the leasing company, leasing generates income from a vehicle the car leasing company 
            still owns and will be able to sell at auction or lease again once the original lease has 
            expired. As consumers will typically use a leased vehicle for a shorter period of time 
            than one they buy outright, leasing may generate repeat customers more quickly, which 
            may fit into various aspects of a finance company’s business model.<br><br>
            Car Lease agreement:<br>
            Car leasing agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee and limit the number 
            of miles a customer can drive (for passenger cars, a common mileage is 10,000 to 15,000 
            miles per year of the car lease). If the mileage allowance is exceeded, a per-mile fee 
            is charged. Customers can negotiate a higher mileage allowance, for a higher lease payment. 
            Car lease agreements usually specify how much wear and tear on the vehicle is allowable, 
            and the customer may face a fee if the car is not in good condition at the end of the lease.
            <br><br>
            At the end of a leasing term, the customer must either return the car or vehicle to the car 
            leasing company, or purchase it. The end of lease price is usually agreed upon when the lease 
            is signed but may be affected by car condition and mileage.
